Jump & Puke - for iPad
----------------------

"Jump & Puke" is a game for iPad that was designed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam'12.

Introduction
------------

Escape! Jump! Puke!

You've been eaten by a snake, escape! Your size will decrease with time as the snake is digesting you. You can get bigger by eating stuff and you can decrease again if you puke!

Hurray! You escaped! Unfortunately, the snake is eating his tail, you have to start again. Now, when you need to eat something to get bigger, you have to eat what you puked last time!

Enjoy!
